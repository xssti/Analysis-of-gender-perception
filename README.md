# Analysis-of-gender-perception

In this project, we are trying to analyse how the perception of women has changed before and after they were given voting rights. Little bit about our data set, we extracted the data from Hansard Website - https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/index.html
We used Beautiful soup to extract the data from hansard website. The data extraction files can be found in this repository. The extracted data can be found in the shared drive - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ALfa6fDN_9zRUk9PVA in merged_files folder. For all the updated jupyter workbooks, please check the folder ADS-2 
To run the female and male pronoun count analysis - Run the Pronoun count jupyter notebook from "clean the files" section, replace the directory path with the merged-files path in the google drive and run the code.
For word-embeddings, choose the new-tokenized-detabes folder and store it in your local. Run the wordembeddings and fasttext-model-1 notebooks. 
For training the data on bert model, take the merged-files folder from google drive and save it in your local and replace the directory path in Bert-Updated-W notebook and train the model.
